## What I Accomplished

Throughout my internship journey during the summer of 2025, I was able to have the opportunity of creating my own hands-on project after learning and working with various AI automation tools.

While designing this project, I had also ventured out into exploring various subjects such as networking. With this, I created a separate Discord bot that sent various HTTP methods, in particular, POST and PULL requests to n8n's webhooks to interact with APIs and webservices. 

From utilizing OpenAI, I managed to design an AI Agent that acted as a chatbot for any of the user's questions. While the chatbot was able to respond, there was also another feature where the AI would determine if the user needed actual help from one of the moderators in the Discord server or was just querying to the bot. 

With my interest in cybersecurity, I had constructed a logging mechanism that was linked to Google Cloud services such as Google Sheets. In the file, the AI Agent would create a formatted row of [username, user_id, channel_id, feedback, and time (during the query)].
